// When text says "upstream is gone" the computer believes that there was something there before but doen't know what exactly.
// "git push origin main" tells GitHub to basically download everything on the computer to save it.
// the green bar on the left hand side means that the line isn't yet saved but the computer recognizes it

// a variabe is essentialy an invisiable box. You can out whatever you want into the box
// and then if you "call" the variable, it will tell you what it contains.

// let is a command to create a new variable. It pulls a box out of the aether and gives it a name.

// there are techicaly 3 kinds of variables in javascript

let first = 1;
const second = 2;
var third = 3;

// when having two things that are the same like "first = 1" and "first = 1+1" whatever comes second, overrides the first command
// telling the computer to use the second code over the first code.
// "const" will not allow you to change that variable since it is constant and it wont allow that varibale to EVER be changed
// like if you set "const second = 2;" and then try and override that code with "second = 4;" that const will keep the number the same

// OPERATORS: +, -, *, /, ** (exponent), % (modulo/mod)
// modulo is the remainder of long form of division so 6 % 3 = 0 (3 goes into 6 with a remainder of 0)
