<!-- To make a link in HTML, you must use an "anchor" tag -->

<a href="https://www.badinhs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is a link to Badin's homepage.</a>

<!-- There are two kinds of links, relative and absolute. Our example to Badin's homepage was an absolute link.
 A relative link travels within a given directory. -->
        <a href="pages/about.html"> About me</a>
<!-- ^ This is a relative link. It dosen't have an "https://", it doesn't have a .com or .org. or .anything.
 As such, it navigates relative to the sit the link is found on. -->
